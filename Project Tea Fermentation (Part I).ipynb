    "Welcome to UpLevel mini-projects! In this series, you're challenged to independently work (with our guidance) with data that you will collect to UpLevel yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope you're excited to embark on this adventure.\n",
    "### Warning:\n",
    "This isn't just any coding course or programmes, where you receive helper code as you move from one code block to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is when things get <em>real</em>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will receive instructions to execute a task along with an intended outcome. Most importantly, we will provide you with directions you can go to, to pick up code independently and implement it in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry though, we'll be dropping lots of resources you can consult and these readings will contain everything you need to succeed. You can also perform independent research to find answers independently. You just have to read closely and pick out the parts that make most sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>We make you do this not because we're lazy bastards but because being able to indepedently find code is a highly underrated skill and that's something all companies look out for.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're really stuck and are on the verge of giving up, we gotchu fam. Head on over to https://www.facebook.com/UpLevelSG/ and post your questions there. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we'll be doing:\n",
    "In this project, we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data collection and literature review (Part I)\n",
    "2. <font color = 'orange'>[Google Colab]</font> Setting up project environment and splitting data for project (Part II)\n",
    "3. <font color = 'orange'>[Google Colab]</font> Building a neural network from scratch to classify tea fermentation level (Part III)\n",
    "4. <font color = 'orange'>[Google Colab]</font> Extract local binary patterns from the image data\n",
    "5. <font color = 'orange'>[Google Colab]</font> Perform machine learning modelling to classify tea fermentation based on local binary patterns (Part V)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations:\n",
    "We're not going to sugarcoat it - it'll be challenging at times. You have to promise to put in the time and effort to UpLevel yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we promise you that it'll ultimately be fun and rewarding, and you'll come out of it stronger and more confident than before."

    "<p>You're a tea farmer in Kenya.</p>\n",
    "<p>Before tea can be sold, the tea must be fermented. If it is under- or over-fermented, the taste profile of the tea is non-optimal and you would get a bad taste.</p> \n",
    "<p>Testing for the correct levels of fermentation is manual and time-consiming, and the constant activity introduces the risk of tea spoilage. Image recognition is a safe and cheap way to test for fermentation levels instead since you can assess the level of fermentation remotely.</p>\n",
    "<p>You came acros a research publication describing exactly what you need. In this project, you will replicate the study and use computer vision + machine learning techniques to classify levels of tea fermentaion based on their images.</p> \n",
